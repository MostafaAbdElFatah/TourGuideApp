    <array name="tourist_places_description">
        <item>The Pyramids of Giza are Cairo\'s number one half-day trip and a must-do attraction on
            everyone\'s itinerary. Right on the edge of the city, these fourth dynasty funerary
            temples have been wowing travelers for centuries and continue to be one of the country\'s
            major highlights. Despite the heat, the dust, and the tourist hustle, you can\'t miss
            a trip here.</item>
        <item>The absolutely staggering collection of antiquities displayed in Cairo\'s
            Egyptian Museum makes it one of the world\'s great museums.
            You would need a lifetime to see everything on show. The museum was
            founded in 1857 by French Egyptologist August Mariette and moved to its
            current home - in the distinctive powder-pink mansion in Downtown Cairo - in 1897.</item>
        <item>Al-Azhar Mosque is the finest building of Cairo\'s Fatimid era, and one of the city\'s
            earliest surviving mosques, completed in AD 972. It\'s also one of the world\'s oldest
            universities.</item>
        <item>This small church-filled cluster of twisty laneways lies within the walls of
            Old Babylon where the Roman Emperor Trajan first built a fortress along the Nile.
            Parts of the Roman towers still preside over the main street.</item>
        <item>Khan el-Khalili is one of the world\'s great shopping experiences.
            This Middle Eastern souq (bazaar) is a labyrinthine collection of
            skinny alleyways established as a shopping district in AD 1400 that
            still rings with the clang of metal workers and silversmiths.</item>
        <item>In a commanding location at the foot of the Mokattam Hills, Cairo\'s citadel
            was built by Saladin in 1176.</item>
        <item>One of the finest examples of Mamluk architecture in the world, Sultan Hassan Mosque
            is a vision of Arabic artistry with an abundance of stalactite detailing and
            intricate arabesque features. It was built in 1356-63 for the Sultan Hassan el-Nasir.</item>
        <item>Of all the Islamic Cairo district\'s gates, Bab Zuweila is the most interesting.
            You can climb to the top of this medieval era relic (built in the 11th century)
            for some amazing rooftop views over Islamic Cairo.</item>
        <item>The northern section of Al-Muizz li-Din Allah Street is rimmed by
            fine Mamluk buildings that have been painstakingly restored to their former glory.
            The Madrassa of as-Salih Ayyub, built in 1247, is a showcase of the tranquil
            simplicity of Islamic architecture.</item>
        <item>The second oldest mosque still standing in Cairo, Ibn Tulun Mosque,
            was built between AD 876 and 879 and modeled on the Kaaba in Mecca (Saudi Arabia).
            At the time it was built, it was the largest mosque in existence.</item>
        <item>The Nile island of Gezira is home to the district of Zamalek and the majority of Cairo\'s arty
            boutiques and hipster restaurants. Dating from the mid 19th century, the entire area has a distinctly
            European feel to its architecture with wide boulevards rimmed by Jacaranda trees and splendidly
            ornate Belle Ã‰poque mansions (many of which are now home to various embassies).</item>
        <item>Lovely Roda Island - just south of Gezira Island - is home to Monastirli Palace,
            once the residence of an Ottoman pasha. Inside the palace gardens, right at the
            island\'s southern tip, is Cairo\'s Nilometer - that was used to measure the ebb and
            flow of the Nile and predict the annual flood heights.</item>
        <item>Caliph Al-Hakim is one of the most fascinating rulers of Egypt. This Fatimid leader was
            renowned for his terrifying rule over the land, which included frequent murders of his royal
            household staff, nightly patrols of the streets of his city dressed incognito on a donkey to make
            sure his subjects were behaving themselves, and issuing bizarre rulings across the country
            (such as banning the eating of the Egyptian mallow-leaf called molokheya because only he wanted
            to be able to consume it).</item>
        <item>If you want to capture a sense of late 19th-century Cairo when the city was nicknamed
            the "Paris of the East" take a stroll through the downtown district with your gaze diverted up
            at the car-exhaust blackened architecture rather than on the bedlam at street level.</item>
        <item>The vast necropolis of Saqqara is home to the "other pyramids" and a day trip out here
            is just as rewarding as a trip to Giza\'s pyramids.
            Location: 30 kms south of Cairo</item>
        <item>The Synagogue is an incredible example of the diversity of architecture in Cairo and
            represents a myriad of different styles (Baroque, Art Deco) in bas relief with
            overlays of Pharonic Art. </item>
